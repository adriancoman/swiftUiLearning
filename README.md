# Swift UI Experimenting

As a personal challenge, I decided to try my hand at SwiftUI to compare its complexity with Jeckpack Compose better.

I was pleasantly surprised by how similar it is to use and how fast I got to set up the project and run it (~3 hours).

I also wanted to try my hand at writing some basic unit tests for the ViewModel. 

The project mimics the UI of Pago that you can download [here](https://pago-app.onelink.me/Enzc/9uh5c8v3).
